# TinyCORS ðŸŒ±

A tiny CORS Anywhere proxy made with Go.

Adds CORS headers to each request to be able to call APIs that require CORS, without setting up your own server. Just start up this Docker container and start sending requests.

All requests to this proxy are allowed with this header: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *!` and proxied to the supplied URL. Also see [CORS Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) and [enable-cors.org](https://enable-cors.org/server.html).

## Why another CORS proxy?

The most popular [CORS Anywhere image](https://hub.docker.com/r/imjacobclark/cors-container/tags) (500k+ downloads at time of writing), uses the `node:10-stretch` image making it 337MB big, which is a lot for what it does.
One of the smaller ones just uses an [Nginx configuration](https://hub.docker.com/r/shakyshane/nginx-cors) and is 17MB.

This one uses Go (which compiles to a binary) and is an excellent candidate for [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/). The result is an image of just ~12MB!

## Usage

When running on the default port, e.g. go to http://localhost:3000/?get=https://www.mdworld.nl

### Go

`go run tinycors.go`

or with optional flags:

`go run tinycors.go -port 9009 -origins http://localhost:3000`

or build first:

`go build tinycors.go`
`./tinycors`

### Docker

```
docker build -t mdworld/tinycors .
docker run --rm --name tinycors -p 3000:3000 mdworld/tinycors
```

or with optional flags:

`docker run --rm --name tinycors -p 9009:9009 mdworld/tinycors -port 9009 -origins http://localhost:3000`

### Docker Compose

Example docker-compose.yml:

```
version: '3.8'
services:
    tinycors:
        ports:
            - "9009:9009"
        command: -port 9009 -origins http://localhost:3000
        image: mdworld/tinycors
        container_name: tinycors
```

## TODO

* Change `/?get=x` to `/x` -> do not rewrite `/http://x` to `/http:/x`, could use `r.URL.EscapedPath()` and split after the protocol and inject `//`
* Reduce size below 7 MB (locally it shows 12.MB with `docker images | grep tinycors` but it shows 6MB on hub.docker.com)
